# CMU 11-785 Deep Learning Spring 2020 (Bhiksha Raj) - completed assignments

This repo contains the assignments that I completed while self-studying this course.

Each of the 4 homework assignments (HW1 - HW4) consists of two parts:

Part 1 (Autolab component) - Required me to write implementations of deep learning modules using Numpy, given skeleton code. This was incredibly useful as it provided an opportunity to develop an in-depth understanding of the principles and computations "under the hood" of deep learning APIs such as PyTorch. A further benefit of this is that it provides a strong foundation to build on to be able to hand-craft custom implementations (for example in research papers), should that be necessary.

Part 2 (Kaggle component) - Required me to use the PyTorch deep learning API to be able to get a feel for the different architectures, optimisation principles, and heuristic engineering tricks involved in deep learning, without worrying too much about the nuts-and-bolts of low-level implementation.
